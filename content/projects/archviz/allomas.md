This was one of my first 3D projects - started in when I was 12 - because our bus station was so dilapidated.
The first renders were pretty bad but it got really popular around the town. Of course nothing happened and it still looks the same. Over the years I revisited it a few times when I got new ideas, most of the images here are newer re-renders of the original model shown in the video.
